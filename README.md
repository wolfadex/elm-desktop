# elm-desktop

WIP, PoC, framework for building desktop apps with Elm. The basic layout is a `Server.elm`, `Types.elm`, and `Window.elm` which you as the user modify and build your app on top off, e.g. everything in `src/`.

To compile run `npm run dev:build` and to start your app run `npm run dev:start`.

Currently depends on a little bit of Deno too.
